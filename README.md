# Face-Recognition-using-FaceNet

This project demonstrates face recognition using the FaceNet model. It provides functionality to register and recognize faces using embeddings generated by FaceNet.

## Overview

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook that:

- **Registers Faces**: Captures and processes images to create face embeddings and stores them in a database.
- **Recognizes Faces**: Captures an image, processes it to create an embedding, and compares it to the stored embeddings to identify the person.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
